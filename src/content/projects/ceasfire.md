## Background

Gun violence takes the lives or injures 4,600 Pennsylvanians every year. And there isn't a single community in the state that is unaffected by this epidemic. The Common Agenda addresses each major source of this devastation by bringing together more than 130 organizations to advocate for solutions that will save lives.

## Details

### Deliverable

An interactive GIS map of Pennsylvania with:
- Pinpoints of shootings
- Information on victim: name, link to news articles
- Label characteristic: mass suicide? mass killing?
- Link to CeaseFirePA page with online petition for corresponding type of gun violence (e.g. mass suicide page)
- Aggregate statistics of different types of gun violence

### Data Source

The Gun Violence Archive and The Trace provide individual observations for each gun violence event, including details like location, date, and victim details. County coroners would need to be contacted to request data on gun suicides in their jurisdictions.

### Impact

The resulting map will be used on the website, in the media, and in reports. It will serve as an impactful data visualization.
