## Background

The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF) operates comprehensive clinical programs, research initiatives, and advocacy efforts to combat pediatric HIV/AIDS across 17 countries and over 15,000 healthcare sites. Timely, accurate, and accessible data from clinic sites is essential for effective decision-making, particularly during global disruptions such as travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. To maintain robust data collection despite limited mobility, EGPAF sought innovative solutions to remotely gather and visualize critical information.

## Project Details

Collaborating with EGPAF, the SUDS team developed a scalable mobile data collection and analytics system tailored to address EGPAF's global data challenges. The project included:

- **Mobile Data Collection Platform**: Creating a secure and intuitive mobile app enabling local healthcare staff to report key indicators such as COVID-related staffing shortages, medical equipment availability, and patient attendance trends.
- **Evaluation of Tools and Technologies**: Assessing and selecting suitable tools and methodologies for efficient mobile data gathering and cloud storage, considering factors such as offline capabilities, ease of use, and scalability.
- **Cloud-based Data Storage and Management**: Ensuring secure, reliable, and accessible storage of real-time site-level data to facilitate seamless analysis and reporting.
- **Interactive Power BI Dashboard**: Developing a comprehensive, user-friendly dashboard enabling EGPAF’s country teams and global headquarters to rapidly visualize, explore, and analyze site-level data, enhancing strategic planning and resource allocation.

## Deliverables

- **Custom Mobile Application**: Easy-to-use tool deployed across multiple sites, facilitating immediate, cloud-based data collection from local clinics.
- **Power BI Analytics Dashboard**: Dynamic visualizations clearly illustrating site-specific and aggregated data trends, supporting timely, data-driven decision-making at both local and global levels.
- **Cloud-Based Data Infrastructure**: Robust data storage and retrieval system providing reliable access to critical information for all EGPAF stakeholders.
- **Documentation and Training Materials**: Comprehensive user guides and training documentation to facilitate easy adoption and ongoing use of the new data system by global teams.

## Outcomes

The introduction of the mobile data collection platform and interactive Power BI dashboard significantly enhanced EGPAF’s capacity to respond rapidly to evolving healthcare challenges. With timely and accurate site-level insights, EGPAF effectively navigated operational disruptions caused by the pandemic and improved program management globally. This improved visibility directly strengthened EGPAF’s ability to allocate resources efficiently, ensuring continued delivery of essential HIV/AIDS services, ultimately benefiting thousands of children and families worldwide.
