## Background

An estimated 558,899 children (unique incidents) were victims of abuse and neglect in the U.S. in 2022, the most recent year for which there is national data. That's 8 children out of every thousand. Left untreated, the trauma of child abuse can lead to mental health problems, behavioral changes, and physical health problems.

A Caring Place operates in a tri-state area, filling significant gaps in child advocacy services, especially in regions lacking dedicated children's advocacy centers (CACs). In the 2023 calendar year, the organization provided forensic interviews or medical exams to nearly 200 children.

## Details

The team analyzed patterns in the types of cases handled to better understand the local landscape of child abuse and to assist in proactive measures for prevention. For instance, analyze how cases may differ across different geographic areas or examine the demographics of victims and abusers. This will help gather for successful prosecution of offenders.

## Deliverables

- A comprehensive report summarizing findings, trends, and recommendations based on the data analyzed, including various visualizations based on historical case data.

- A presentation delivered at the end of each semester.
