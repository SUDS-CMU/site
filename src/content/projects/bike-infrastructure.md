## Background

BikePGH organizes with communities across Allegheny County to create safe, car-free transportation options via infrastructure and public policy. They envision a Pittsburgh where people can thrive without needing to own a car â€“ making Pittsburgh a world class leader in clean, affordable, and convenient transportation.

## Details

The SUDS team helped BikePGH's Advocacy team visualize data on bike infrastructure using ArcGIS, creating a map looking at miles of bike trails, miles of bike lanes, and other data in each Pittsburgh district. The goal was to illuminate how bike-friendly different districts in Pittsburgh are, and create a map that is presentable to the City of Pittsburgh to aid in Bike PGH's advocacy for more bike infrastructure.
