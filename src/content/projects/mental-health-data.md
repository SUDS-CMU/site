## Background

About 10 million people are injured each year from intimate partner violence (IPV), i.e. domestic violence. Supporting more than 7,500 individuals each year, WC&S's Sanctuary Model is a holistic approach to helping injured children and adults recover from damaging effects of domestic violence through trauma-informed care, compassion, and mindfulness.

## Details

Deliverables include but are not limited to:

- Reformatted PHQ-9 Quick Depression Assessment; contributed to entry of new data.

- Streamlined and automated the data cleaning process to create datasets for the Program Effectiveness Dashboard and Demographics Dashboard.

- Analyzed the response rates for each survey question. This helps WC&S to assess client comfort in disclosing information for self-reported questions and measure efficiency of the data collection process for required fields.
